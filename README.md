# intelligent-book-recommendation-engine
Implemented intelligent book recommendation system  for an online library 

# Project 1: Implementation of intelligent book recommendation system engine for an online library using Python leveraging on Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn: Project Overview
 • Developed a suitable module for retrieving data from the provided datasets using an appropriate data structure, string manipulation, iteration, selection, etc based on
    procedural programming concepts
    
 • Designed and implemented 7 functions that computed the similarity scores between users or books
 
 • Designed a function that computes similarity scores between: 1) any two users; 2) any two books and 3) a user and a book
 
 • Implementated similarity metrics for collaborative/content-based recommendation systems using object oriented programming concepts and Python data science libraries in the recommendation system domain
